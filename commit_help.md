* Before committing changes, you need to make sure that all files are added to the index.
* You can view the status of the index with the command `git status` .
* Use `git add filename` to add a specific file or `git add .` to add all files.
* To add all the changed files with one command and make a commit, run `git commit -am "commit message"`
* No new files will be added
